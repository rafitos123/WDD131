            <h2>John 1:1-5</h2>
            <p>In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. The same was in the beginning with God. 
                All things were made by him; and without him was not any thing made that was made. 
                In him was life; and the life was the light of men. And the light shineth in darkness; and the darkness comprehended it not.</p>
